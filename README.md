### What I learned

I build several tutorial for website by following tutorial in youtube. At first, i though this website creation is quite easy since eventhough i have a difficulty to follow the tutorials, at the end, i can make the website running on my local computers similar to what the tutorial shown (not really the same because different version of framework need the code to be adjusted or the final result need to be modified)

Since im confident with my ability to do the website design, i sign-up to Front-End Mentor Pro to have a pro challange on creating the website and start doing it on my own. this is where i realize that copying and following the tutorial doesn't make you have the skill of the youtuber when creating the website. A lot of preparation that is made by them (like preparing the style, standard color, gradient, font size,etc which already given before the tutorial happens) now need to be created by my self. I found that it really need effort to nail down the theory that you have and apply it to the real world project (or real website i might say). So this time, i really start again from the basic on how to prepare the website creation according to the design system provided by Front-End Mentor.

After the preparation is done, the next hurdle is when creating the website itself. It turns out that i know very little understanding about the CSS, javascript and react since i think i know how to proceed the website execution but it really hard to implement what i do in the tutorials in this real project. It really need determination and consistency to overcome the errors happen during this website creation. To minimize the error, i really go to the basic which i code every line without using sophisticated method that can make my code cleaner. at the end of the day, eventhough some picture is not added in the website, i think im pretty satisfied with the result that i get.


### Continued development

I will learn more about CSS for styling and practice more website creation using react and try to make the code a little bit cleaner (like what i saw in the youtube video tutorial)
